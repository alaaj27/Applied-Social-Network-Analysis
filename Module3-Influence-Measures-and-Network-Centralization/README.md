# WEEK3 : Influence Measures and Network Centralization

- Explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network, using measures such as Degree, Closeness, and Betweenness centrality, Page Rank, and Hubs and Authorities.
- Explore the assumptions each measure makes, the algorithms we can use to compute them, and the different functions available on NetworkX to measure centrality.

- In the assignment, you'll practice choosing the most appropriate centrality measure on a real-world setting.
