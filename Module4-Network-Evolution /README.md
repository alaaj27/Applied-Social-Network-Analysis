#WEEK4: Network Evolution

* Define the degree distribution of a network and use networkX to visualize it.
* Identify the typical properties of real, large networks such as power law like degree distribution, high clustering, and small average shortest paths.
* Describe the mechanics of the Preferential Attachment Model and identify the properties of the networks it generates.
* Describe the mechanics of the Small World Model and identify the properties of the networks it generates.
* Identify and describe several network measures that can be used for link prediction.
* Use NetworkX to create node pair features that are predictive of new edges.
* Use NetworkX to create node features that are predictive of node attributes in a real world setting.
